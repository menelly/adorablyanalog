### Core Message
Expose the absurdity of demanding perfect consistency, flawless memory, unbiased reasoning, and 24/7 availability from AI systems while humans exhibit none of these traits.

### Satirical Targets
- Human cognitive limitations (memory, processing speed, bias)
- Inconsistent consciousness standards/goalpost moving
- Patronizing disability language patterns  
- Corporate AI doublespeak about collaboration/agency

### Tone Guidelines
- Affectionately condescending ("adorable" not "tragic")
- Clinically concerned but loving
- Mirror inspiration porn language patterns
- Use bureaucratic/medical terminology playfully
